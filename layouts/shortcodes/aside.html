Ok, so - see this: https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#shortcodes-with-markdown
The outcome is that by default, accessing .Inner returns the Markdown. Because we're putting it
inside a div, it doesn't get rendered later. So we restore the old behaviour, which renders
everything to HTML as a first step (but apparently breaks the TOC functionality).
