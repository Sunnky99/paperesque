# capnfabs-lite

The theme in use on capnfabs.net.

This _probably_ isn't ready for drop-in production use (hence why it hasn't been published on the Hugo themes site), but it's got a couple of interesting ideas that I wanted to make available for other people to borrow.

Those features are:

- A mechanism for excluding source images after they've been processed or resized, and
- Visual differentiation for drafts.

The explanation for how it all works is in [this blog post](https://capnfabs.net/posts/hugo-theme-exclude-processed-images/), so take a look there for the comprehensive explanation, and what you need to do to integrate these ideas into your own themes.
